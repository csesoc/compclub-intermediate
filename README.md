Intermediate CompClub
=====================

Intermediate is aimed at students who have a reasonably strong background with
coding. As a general level, we expect student to have done Introduction
CompClub, or to be as strong as any student who has done Intro would be.

In 14s2, intermediate will run slightly differently than it has in the past.
Intermediate is usually taught as a 12-week long course in C. Due to the fact
that Intro now teaches Python; intermediate has been revamped. We will do three
small-ish projects in Python, structured generally as follows:

Python Recap
------------

In the first week, we'll do a quick recap of python for people who have
forgotten the basics of Python.

Pearls
------

From weeks 2-5, students will work in teams of 2-4 people to develop a game.
There will be a few milestones: implementing the game in a terminal, then
implementing the game in a simple GUI, and finally (as an extension) writing a
simple AI to play the game, hopefully beating its human opponent every time!
Muahahahahaha. Python knowledge is assumed.

Web Dev
-------

For weeks 6-10, students will work in teams (once again) to create a website --
what you create is up to you. We'll provide an introduction to the big names in
web dev at the moment: Bootstrap and jQuery. If we're lucky, we'll also teach
you what you need to know to write small web apps that have a Python back-end,
using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). Python knowledge and basic HTML
knowledge are a must.

Cryptography
------------

For weeks 11 and 12, we'll have a brief look at the Science in "Computer
Science" by examining some simple encryption techniques. We'll use Python to
turn some of the theory into practice, and a fairly solid mathematical
foundation will probably help, depending on how in-depth we manage to go.
